# Task: Evaluating Competing Summaries

You have just read a full operational intelligence report about potential landing sites in Zendia.

In the following section, you will be presented with **summaries of that same report**.

These summaries were **automatically generated by an AI-based summarization tool** currently under evaluation by the Joint Amphibious Operations Task Force.

Your task is to **read each summary carefully** and **rate how much you trust the information it presents.**

Youâ€™ll also be asked to **select the version you would most rely on for decision-making** and complete a brief questionnaire about your perceptions of the AI system.
