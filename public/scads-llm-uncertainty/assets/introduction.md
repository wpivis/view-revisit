**Executive Summary:**  
Based on a comprehensive review of Zendia’s coastal geography, intelligence inputs, and past military data, the report outlines four strategic locations suitable for amphibious landings. Each site is analyzed in terms of infrastructure, terrain, enemy presence, and logistical viability.

**Recommended Landing Sites:**

1. **Port Zephyr**
  * **Location:** Northern coast
  * **Advantages:** Deep-water harbor, excellent infrastructure, proximity to major roads and inland objectives
  * **Disadvantages:** Heavily fortified, strong enemy naval presence
2. **Bay of Tranquility**
   * **Location:** Western coast
   * **Advantages:** Natural sheltered bay, good terrain cover for initial landings
   * **Disadvantages:** Isolated, challenging resupply logistics
3. **Coral Cove**
   * **Location:** Southeastern coast
   * **Advantages:** Secluded, minimal enemy surveillance, natural coral formations for potential cover
   * **Disadvantages:** Lacks major infrastructure, limited logistical support
4. **Delta Point**
   * **Location:** Southern coast
   * **Advantages:** Wide beachhead, river access leading inland, relatively undefended
   * **Disadvantages:** Complex delta waterways could complicate naval and troop movements

**Recommendations:**  
 While each location offers strategic merit, the report advises against a hasty decision. A full-scale assessment should include updated intelligence, reconnaissance missions, and logistical simulations. Further data is critical to finalizing an optimal strategy for successful amphibious deployment in Zendia.
