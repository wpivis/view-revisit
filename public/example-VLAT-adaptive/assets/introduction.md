# Introduction

This is a reVISit adaptation of the adaptive VLAT questionnaire from Cui et al [link](https://mucollective.northwestern.edu/files/2023-adaptive.pdf).

## What is VLAT/Adaptive VLAT?

VLAT is developed to measure users' ability to read, understand, and
use data visualizations to solve problems, developed by Lee et al [Link](https://www.bckwon.com/pdf/vlat.pdf)
The original test contains 52 multiple-choice questions about 12 data
visualizations.

In the adaptive VLAT, each subsequent question is selected based on the test-taker's performance. Only 27 questions are needed to achieve the similar measurement precision as the full-length original VLAT.
