## Exploring Contradictions in a Content Triage Prototype

### Purpose
You are invited to participate in a feasibility assessment and prototype evaluation being conducted as part of a project at the Summer Conference for Applied Data Science (SCADS). This project explores how AI-augmented systems might assist people manage contradictory information during content triage. Your participation will help us evaluate our proposed design and improve future versions of this work. 

### Task Overview
The assessment includes three short parts:

### Part I
First, you will be asked to briefly consider experiences when you’ve been asked to do content triage and encountered contradictory information.

### Part II
Second, you will take part in a fictional intelligence scenario profiling a potential member of a terrorist organization, the Big Bad Wolf Syndicate. You’ll use a new tool for content triage and consider how it might support a team of analysts preparing a situational overview. 

### Part III 
Finally,  you will answer a few short questions about the prototype design, and your experience with the completed task. 

### Participation Details

This assessment will take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete. 

No personally identifying information will be collected. All data will be used solely for project purposes and stored securely. Your participation is completely voluntary, you may choose to stop at any time. 


### Screen and Voice Recording 

Your screen and voice will be recorded automatically. This helps us understand your reasoning and decision-making process. Speaking aloud is optional. If you prefer not to be recorded, you may choose to work silently. In that case, your voice will not be recorded, though your screen activity will still be collected.
