# Contradiction Explorer

## Task Overview

**Overview**

This task involves reviewing news reports and other documents within a fictional intelligence scenario: You are an analyst on the NC State University Intelligence Team monitoring suspected terrorist activity in Raleigh, NC. As part of your task, you will read a mission briefing and access documents using a new tool called “Contradiction Explorer.”

**Your role is to triage these documents using Contradiction Explorer and answer questions based on an RFI as part of a simulated intelligence workflow.** 

Importantly, we are not assessing your skill with the answers to the questions; the task is a means to interacting with the new tool.

On the next page, you will be able to spend some time learning how the tool works.
