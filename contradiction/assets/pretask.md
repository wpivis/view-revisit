## PART II: Task Introduction (4 minutes)

**Overview**

This task involves reviewing AI-generated summaries within a fictional intelligence scenario. In the scenario, an intelligence team at North Carolina State University is monitoring the potential for the terrorist organization, the Big Bad Wolf Syndicate having a new cell in Raleigh, NC.  The team is preparing a situational overview that may inform a potential security alert and operational recommendations for the Raleigh Police. To support this effort, the Raleigh Police has provided you with a mission briefing and set of documents to triage that may be useful in assessing the situation.

**Your role is to triage these documents and answer the RFI questions as part of a simulated intelligence workflow.** 

After producing your answers to the RFI, you’ll answer brief questions about your experience.

### Mission Briefing

**Organization:** The Big Bad Wolf Syndicate (BBWS) is a domestic terrorism group known for nefarious plans and often engages in illegal activities and intimidation including kidnapping of elderly ladies.

**Location:** BBWS operates across the United States.

**New mission priority:** Previous activity indicates there may be a growing Syndicate den in Raleigh, NC, somewhere near NC State Campus. Agents in Minnesota are predicting an imminent attack possible in Raleigh NC.

**Person of interest:** Mr. Wuf, NCSU’s mascot has previous relationships with wolves in the BBWS, but unclear of his allegiance.

### RFI 
Raleigh Police must improve its understanding of Mr. Wuf's movements, activities,  and network connections. By assessing whether he poses a credible threat in relation to terrorist activities unfolding on campus, they can determine if additional resources should be allocated to monitor his movements or focus on more promising targets.

You have 8 minutes to review the documents and compile the answers with certainty scores to the following questions:

1. What is the relationship between Mr. Wuf, his family, and suspicious activity in Raleigh?   
2. Is the Big Bad Wolf Syndicate operating in Raleigh?  
3. Is there evidence to indicate the NCSU police increase surveillance on Mr. Wuf?

You will receive a warning when there is 1 minute left to finish the task.
