In the next slides, you will see 2 versions of a prototype. This is an abstract productivity app, 
and your task is to click into the Study to-do list, add 3 tasks, check all of the tasks off of the list, 
and return to the home page. Note any feelings you may have while navigating the two different platforms,
as the post-interaction survey will have various questions about how you felt.
